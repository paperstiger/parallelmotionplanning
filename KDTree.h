/** @ingroup Geometry
 * @brief A kd-tree or a node of one.
 *
 * A whole kd-tree is created from the return value of KDTree::Create().
 * At the end of its life, delete it.
 *
 * Members:
 * - splitDim: the split dimension
 * - splitVal: the split value
 * - pos: the node on the positive side of val (that is, the node storing
 *   all points x with x(d)>val)
 * - neg: the node on the negative side of val
 * - pts: if this is a leaf, the set of points contained within
 *
 * XXXXX this note doesnt apply anymore... referencing was problematic XXXXX
 * NOTE: To avoid unnecessary copying, kd-trees only store REFERENCES
 * to the Vectors that are given as input.
 * As a result you must store them in some auxiliary data structure.
